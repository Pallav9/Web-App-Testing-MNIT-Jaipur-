# WEB APP TESTING (MNIT JAIPUR)

In this project rigorous testing is done on the MNIT Website. After testing the website various faults were found and are depicted along with their severity level.


## TABLE OF CONTENTS

1. Funtional Testing
2. User Interface Testing
3. Compatibility testing
4. Performance Testing
5. Security Testing


## Functional Testing

In functional Testing, we Test all links in your web pages are working correctly and make sure there are no broken links. Links to be checked will include -
1. Outgoing links
2. Internal links
3. Anchor Links
4. Mail to Links

We Test Forms are working as expected or not. This will include-

2. Check default values are being populated
3. Once submitted, the data in the forms are submitted to a live database or is linked to a working email address.


## User Interface Testing
 In this testing, we will test the navigation bar and different internal and external links in the website along with forms. We will test Menus, buttons or links to different pages on your site that should be easily visible and consistent on all web pages.

## Compatibility testing:

Browser Compatibility Test: 

The same website in different browsers will display differently. So, we will test if the web application is being displayed correctly across browsers and authentication is working fine

## Performance Testing
In this testing, we will test whether the website responds rapidly, amount of workload handled at a time and website is stable in case of varying workloads or not.
## Security Testing
Testing Activities will include-
1. Test unauthorized access to secure pages should not be permitted
2. Restricted files should not be downloadable without appropriate access
3. Check sessions are automatically killed after prolonged user inactivity.
